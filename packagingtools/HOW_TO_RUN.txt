HOW TO RUN SupportHelper ON OTHER COMPUTERS
==========================================

If Windows blocks SupportHelper.exe with a security warning:

METHOD 1 - Quick Fix:
1. Right-click on SupportHelper.exe
2. Select "Properties"
3. If you see "This file came from another computer" checkbox
4. Check "Unblock" and click OK
5. Run the file normally

METHOD 2 - Windows Defender Warning:
1. When you see the Windows Defender warning
2. Click "More info"
3. Click "Run anyway"
4. Check "Always run" if available

METHOD 3 - PowerShell (Admin):
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to the folder with SupportHelper.exe
3. Run: Unblock-File SupportHelper.exe
4. Run the application

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
- Windows protects against unknown applications
- The EXE is not digitally signed (certificates cost $300+/year)
- This is normal for independent developers

FOR ORGANIZATIONS:
- Ask IT to add SupportHelper.exe to the whitelist
- Or host on a trusted internal network location

The application is SAFE - it's just Windows being protective!
